This [Django][django] project is a starter project for managing a basketball tournament. Do note that this implementation makes [assumptions](#assumptions) to simplify the implementation.

The code has been deployed [here][deployment] on [Heroku][heroku] backed by a [PostgreSQL][postgresql] database for demonstration purposes. Please refer to [Using the Postman collection](#using-the-postman-collection) to learn how to invoke the APIs.

Be sure to visit my [blog][blog] to check out my other work.

## Getting started

If you want to run the project locally pick the local development option here. It is assumed that you have set up your development machine with `git`, `Python`, `pip` and any other dependencies. 

In the cloud deployment section deploying on Heroku and containerized options are discussed.

Pushing the code to the source control triggers a build & deployment pipelines on Heroku and [CircleCI][circleci] respectively. The build pipeline runs the test cases and pushes the test coverage report to the [Coveralls][coveralls] dashboard. The [UptimeRobot][uptimerobot] monitoring dashboard monitors the system status. 

Please click on the `GitHub badges` in the `README.md` to navigate to the aforementioned dashboards.

### Local development

When running the application locally the application will point to the [SQLite][sqlite] db. The database with the data is included with the source code to get started without having to run the DDL and DML scripts.

[Helper scripts](#helper-scripts) are provided to prevent having to remember the commands.

#### Using virtual environments( recommended)

Note that you need to have `virtualenv` installed on your machine in addition to the aforementioned dependencies. If you do not have it on your machine please follow the instructions [here][venv] to install it.
Clone the project and `cd` into the project directory.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/pwelagedara/django_nba_starter
cd django_nba_starter
```

Create the virtual environment, activate virtual environment and install the dependencies.
```shell
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the project. Optionally you can load a new dataset.
```shell
python manage.py runserver

# OR use the helper script
./runserver.sh
```

To load the data into SQlite please use the following commands or run [init.sh](init.sh) helper script.
```shell
# Delete existing database
rm -f db.sqlite3

# Make migrations
python manage.py makemigrations

# Make view migrations
python manage.py makeviewmigrations

# Migrate
python manage.py migrate

# Create super user if you want to log into Django admon
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Initialize data using management commands
python manage.py initializedata
```


#### Without virtual environments

### Cloud deployment options
Mention the data generation script
. Also mention the url and credentials( mention that you will share the password seperately) to heroku. 
### Endpoints

## Using the Postman collection

### Pre request scripts

### Postman tests

## Helper scripts

## Build status

## Test coverage

## Uptime

## Database configuration

### Database model
![alt text](support/database-model.png?raw=true)
### Use of database views

## 90th percentile calculation

## Pagination

## Performance optimizations

## Exception handling

## Assumptions

- If the scores are equal Away Team wins as that team plays with a disadvantage 
- This is a knockout tournament
- Analytics data(`total_time_online`) is captured separately using Google Analytics. It is recorded in minutes in the database
- Super Admin is the Django Super User
- Performance optimization is not a primary concern due to the smaller dataset
- Home Team and Away Team in a game
- Supports one Tournament

## Known issues

### Fix issue with 400 bad request for login endpoint

### View migration failure for Postgres on Heroku
