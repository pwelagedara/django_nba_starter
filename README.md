## Getting started

Mention the data generation script. Also mention the url and credentials( mention that you will share the password seperately) to heroku. 

### Local development environment

#### Using virtual environments
```
pubuduwelagedara@pubudus-MacBook-Air django_nba_starter % python -m venv venv
pubuduwelagedara@pubudus-MacBook-Air django_nba_starter % source ./venv/bin/activate
(venv) pubuduwelagedara@pubudus-MacBook-Air django_nba_starter % python --version
Python 3.9.1
(venv) pubuduwelagedara@pubudus-MacBook-Air django_nba_starter % pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Without virtual environments

### Cloud deployment

### Endpoints

## Using the Postman collection

### Pre request scripts

### Postman tests

## Helper scripts

## Build status

## Test coverage

## Uptime

## Database configuration

### Database model

### Use of database views

## 90th Percentile Calculation

## Pagination

## Performance optimizations

## Exception handling

## Assumptions

- If the scores are equal Away Team wins as that team plays with a disadvantage 
- This is a knockout tournament
- Analytics data(`total_time_online`) is captured separately using Google Analytics. It is recorded in minutes in the database
- Super Admin is the Django Super User
- Performance optimization is not a primary concern due to the smaller dataset
- Home Team and Away Team in a game
- Supports one Tournament

## Known issues

### Fix issue with 400 bad request for login endpoint

### View migration failure for Postgres on Heroku
