Mention the data generation script

### Local development

#### Without venv

#### Using venv

### Cloud deployment

## Using the Postman collection

## List of helper scripts

### Pre request scripts

### Postman tests

## Build status

## Test coverage

## Uptime

#### Database configuration

## Database model

## 90th Percentile Calculation

### Use of database views

### Performance implications

## Pagination

## Assumptions

- If the scores are equal Away Team wins as that team plays with a disadvantage
- Analytics data(`total_time_online`) is captured separately using Google Analytics 
- Super Admin is the Django Super User
- Performance optimization is not a primary concern due to the smaller dataset
- Home Team and Away Team in a game
- Supports one Tournament

## Known issues

### View migrations failed for Postgres
